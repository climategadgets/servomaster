        <h1>ServoMaster: Quick Start</h1>
        
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</a>,
                 <code>--with-ANT</code> configure option. Minimum version
                 required is 1.4.
            
            <li> Sun's <code>javac.jar</code> or <code>tools.jar</code>,
                 <code>--with-JAVA_COMPILER</code> configure option. Examine
                 the Ant documentation to find out where it fits.
            
            <li> <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/">Apache
                 Xerces-J</a>, <code>--with-XERCES</code> configure option. 
                 Current version will suffice.
                 
             <li> For Linux boxes, Trent Jarvi's <a
                  href="http://www.rxtx.org/">RxTx</a> - Java Communications
                  API implementation.

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        
        The ServoMaster is being developed on the Linux and Solaris boxes,
        and I am not interested in building for Windows. However, it is
        possible to build it on Windows using <a
        href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, and of course it is
        possible to use it on Windows as soon as you get the jar file (jar
        distribution, along with <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34418">source
        distribution</a>, is planned).
        
        <h2>Build</h2>
        
        Hardcore OpenSource people will find the build process comfortable -
        it's simple <code>./configure && make all install</code>. However,
        it is highly recommended to run <code>./configure --help</code>
        first, because even though the <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
        is used to adjust the build to the system, the tools used (Ant and
        Xerces) do not have a standard location, thus it has to be
        specified.
        
        <p>
        
        To avoid specifying configure options again and again, it is
        recommended to use the <code>./configure-options</code> file to
        specify them, one item per line. This is how mine looks:
        
        <pre>
--with-ANT=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-ant-1.3/dist/lib/ant.jar
--with-JAVA_COMPILER=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-tools/javac.jar
--with-XERCES=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-ant/proposal/myrmidon/lib/xerces.jar
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Running the result</h2>
        
        There is a class that serves as a testbed and a demo for the package
        - <code>org.freehold.servomaster.view.Console</code>, and
        <code>$prefix/bin/ft_view</code> shell script is a wrapper for it. 
        It takes two parameters: the hardware driver class name, and the
        driver-specific port name. It is completely hardware independent.
        
        <p>
        
        There is no dummy class implementing nonexistent controller that
        doesn't require any hardware, however, the <a
        href="FT639.html">FT639</a> controller the driver for which has been
        already implemented doesn't provide any feedback, so it can be used
        as a demo. The only requirement is that you specify a valid
        unoccupied serial port ID, like this:
        
        <pre>
        $prefix/bin/ft_view \
                org.freehold.servomaster.device.impl.ft.FT639ServoController \
                /dev/ttyS1
        </pre>
        
        where <code>$prefix</code> is where you actually install the package.
        
        <p>
        
        That's it, you should be seeing the console right now.
