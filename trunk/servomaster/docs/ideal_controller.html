                                below will be implemented.  As soon as that

                                As the number of supported servo controllers
                                grows, a necessity for the mapping between
                                the controller models and supported features
                                becomes obvious. It will be provided here
                                soon.

                                An ideal servo controller should be able to do at least this:

                                         dependency is going to be tricky.

                                         there are cases when the servos are

                                         well: even though the actual servo
                                         drivers may be physically and

                                         manner, and share common
                                         properties.
