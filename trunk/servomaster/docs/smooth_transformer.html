            Servomaster: Mixing up transition controllers and coordinate
            transformers
            
        </h1>
        
        The coordinate transformers (see the <a
        href="apidocs/index.html">API documentation</a>) are stacked on top
        of the servo abstraction (actually, the coordinate transformers
        <i>extend</i> the servo interface).
        
        <p>
        
        Since the controlled transition may be supported by the controller
        itself, it makes sense to make the transition controller abstraction
        a part of servo abstraction, unlike coordinate transformer.
        
        <p>
        
        However, there are interesting side effects. Consider this example:
        
        <pre>
            ServoController controller = new FooController();
            Servo servo = controller.getServo("s");
            Servo linearServo = new LinearTransformer(s);
            
            linearServo.setPosition(0);
            <b>servo</b>.attach(new CrawlTransitionController());
            linearServo.setPosition(1);
        </pre>
        
        Pay attention to the fact that the transition controller is attached
        to the servo itself.
        
        <p>
        
        This will require the servo to move as fast as it can to the linear
        0 position, then crawl to the linear 1.0. However, in this example the
        <i>angular</i> movement of the servo will be smooth, not
        <i>linear</i>.
        
        <p>
        
        The more is a difference between the angular position required from
        the servo and the position requested from the topmost transformer,
        the more noticeable this discrepancy will become.
        
        <p>
        
        However, there are cases when this is perfectly acceptable - for
        example, for the high latency systems where the servo controls the
        valves, and the transition time is negligible, but the linearity of
        the control is important.
        
        <p>
        
        Compare:
        
        <pre>
            ServoController controller = new FooController();
            Servo servo = controller.getServo("s");
            Servo linearServo = new LinearTransformer(s);
            
            linearServo.setPosition(0);
            <b>linearServo</b>.attach(new CrawlTransitionController());
            linearServo.setPosition(1);
        </pre>
        
        In this example, the transition controller is attached to the linear
        coordinate transformer, and the <i>linear</i> movement of the servo
        controlled object will be smooth, but not the <i>angular</i>
        movement of the servo.
