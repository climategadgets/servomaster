                <code>controller/silent</code> <em>feature</em> is true if
                the hardware is able to shut off the servos.
                
            </p>
            <p>

                <code>controller/silent</code> <em>property</em> contains
                the currently set shutoff timeout.

                 Servo shutoff is useful for applications where long periods
                 of inactivity may happen - the servo wear and energy
                 consumption are greatly reduced. An example may be found
                 here.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
            
                 Please note that some controllers (like <link
                 href="site:ft639">FT639</link>) are able to support the
                 shutoff on per-controller basis (all the servos are shut
                 off at the same time), some (like <link
                 href="site:phidget_quad">QuadServo</link> and <link
                 href="site:pololu">Pololu</link> family) are able to
                 support the shutoff on per-servo basis (see <link
                 href="site:meta_servo_silent">servo/silent</link>, and some
                 are not able to do it at all.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
            
                 Use the <link
                 href="site:meta_servo_silent">servo/silent</link> feature
                 and property to set the shutoff timeout for the controllers
                 that support per-servo control. For those, the value set
                 with controller/silent will merely be a default.
