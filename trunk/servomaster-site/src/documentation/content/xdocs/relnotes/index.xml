                <p>
                
                    Basically, you're likely to run into a single problem,
                    namely, installing and using <link
                    href="ext:rxtx">RxTx</link> (which you'll need for all
                    serial drivers to work).
                    
                </p>

                    For me, version 1.4-15 worked (and still works, with uptime
                    measured in months) perfectly, however, it can be a real
                    pain in the neck to compile on new platforms, and I don't
                    even remember if I ever compiled it successfully with JDK
                    1.5.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Recently, the situation [allegedly] improved, and versions
                    after 2.1-7pre20 <em>may</em> work without segfaulting
                    within a minute. Caveat emptor.

                <title>USB</title>
                
                <p>
                
                    Starting with release <code>0.6p3dev1</code>, <link
                    href="ext:jusb">jUSB</link> was replaced with <link
                    href="ext:javax-usb"><code>javax.usb</code></link>.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Moreover, to make things more seamless,
                    <code>javax.usb</code> is now prepackaged with
                    ServoMaster, so it should be mostly invisible to you.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    The change was quite drastic and backward incompatible.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Should you run into problems with jUSB-based version,
                    try <code>javax.usb</code>-based version first. Should
                    you run into problems with <code>javax.usb</code>-based
                    version, please <link href="site:bugs">report
                    them</link> so I can fix them right away.
                    
                </p>
                <note>
                
                    Unfortunately, SourceForge doesn't notify me of
                    <em>all</em> new bugs immediately, only those that were
                    assigned to me. You may want to doublecheck your bug
                    report by writing a message to the <link
                    href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=52647">mailing list</link>.

                    You will run into this issue, no matter what interface
                    you're using. You may not notice it at first if you're
                    fiddling with your devices while running your
                    applications as root, or being logged in as the same
                    user you run your applications under, but you will
                    <em>definitely</em> notice them as soon as you start
                    your application as a daemon, or you're working on a
                    remote box with someone logging in and out.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Different distributions handle this issue in a different
                    way, so there's no single answer. If you had run into
                    this issue, and were able to successfully resolve it in
                    an elegant way, your feedback would be <link
                    href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=52647">much appreciated</link> and aggregated
                    into this site, with all the <link
                    href="site:credits">credits</link> given.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    For USB adapters, <link
                    href="ext:hotplug">hotplug</link> is the starting point.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    For serial ports, you're on your own, until someone
                    (maybe you?) donates a universal solution.
