INSTALLATION OPTIONS
====================

ServoMaster may be built using two different approaches:

1. Classic, using "./configure && make install". To follow this path, please
   see the INSTALL-configure file.

2. Easy (or hard, depending on the way you see it). To follow this path,
   please see the INSTALL-Ant file.

Please note that classic way just prepares the properties file for the Ant
install, (${srcdir}/build/.servomaster.properties), so in fact they don't
make too much difference. For the UNIX platform, the classic way is usually
the best, for Windows, oh well, just say #2.

In both approaches, you will have to have the working copies of:

	- Apache Xerces, http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/
	- Jakarta Ant, http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/
	- Java Communications API, http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/
	- For Linux, RxTx, http://www.rxtx.org/

Also recommended is Jakarta Regexp, http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/

CONFIGURATION
=============

- Don't forget to run ./configure --help

- Use the ./configure-options file to override the defaults for configure
  script.

- Use the Ant build properties file (${HOME}/.servomaster.properties}) to
  override the defaults for Ant build.
