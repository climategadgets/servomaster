        <h2>Good things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in inexpensive.
            
            <li> Simple. Takes an hour or less for somebody familiar with
                 the craft to put it together.
                 
            <li> Has a single power source. For me, this might have been a
                 deciding factor.
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bad things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in having limited functionality.
            
            <li> Is a write-only device. It is not possible to even tell
                 whether it is connected to the serial port, save read the
                 status. Minimal functionality, like "controller ready"
                 status reflected on hardware flow control pin, would be
                 great.
                 
            <li> I think the guys really, really underestimate the necessity
                 of higher speed communication. <i>(some math will be placed
                 here when I'm ready)</i>
                 
        </ul>
