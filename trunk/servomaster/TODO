- Add the docs directory to the 'make dist' target
- Figure out the trim works for FT639
- Add more buttons on the Console ("swing" demo, "clock" demo, etc.)
- Make the Console truly controller-independent
- Add getServos() method to the controller - not everybody has 5 of them
- Add enable() method to the servo - equivalent to silent mode for the
  controllers that can support that
