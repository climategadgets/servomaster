Ant installation
================

Disclaimer: For the personal reasons, I'm not interested in perfecting this
way, especially for Windows, so the volunteers to supply the build.bat are
welcome.

For the UNIX platform
=====================

1. Make sure javac is in your PATH
2. cd build
3. sh ./build.sh
4. Pray.

If you're lucky and have a more or less standard system, the preconfigured
build.sh and build.xml contain the locations you need. Otherwise, you will
have to edit these files to reflect the actual locations.

Start with build.sh.
