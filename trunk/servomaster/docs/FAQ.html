        <dl>
        
            <dt> <strong>What is a project status?</strong>
            
            <dd> Architecture is clear, design is done, Java implementation
                 for two controllers (<a href="FT639.html">FT639</a>) and <a
                 href="USB_Phidget.html">PhidgetServo</a>) is done, the
                 production stability is reached (one of the controllers
                 manages my home HVAC system - uptime is measured in weeks
                 and the interruptions occur only when I upgrade the
                 software for the rest of the system). More are coming.
                 
                 <p>
        
            <dt> <strong>Why Java?</strong>
            
            <dd> First of all, this is my current language of choice (though
                 I'm getting back to C++, for memory footprint and
                 performance reasons).  Second, it is the best choice for
                 rapid prototyping. Third, and probably the most important,
                 despite all its drawbacks, it is really platform
                 independent. This last one matters a lot, at least to me.
                 
                 <p>
            
            <dt> <strong>What about C?</strong>
            
            <dd> No C, because this project is not about implementation,
                 it's about reusable architecture. C++ port, however, is
                 being implemented, with the same architecture (<a
                 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/servomaster/servomaster-cpp/">browse
                 the CVS repository</a>). Don't ask about the timeframe. If
                 you want to help, you're welcome.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <dt> <strong>Are there other hardware controller drivers
                 coming?</strong>
                 
            <dd> You bet. Currently, <a href="USB_Phidget4.html">USB
                 PhidgetAdvancedServo</a> driver is in the works. The next
                 one is probably <a
                 href="http://www.ohmark.co.nz/dsc.php">Ohmark Digital Servo
                 Controller</a>, unless I get to implement my <a
                 href="future.html">crazy ideas</a> sooner. Why Ohmark? It
                 supports the transitions in hardware.
                 
                 <p>
             
            <dt> <strong>How do you select the hardware controllers to
                 implement the drivers for?</strong>
            
            <dd> First one I bought. The rest were donated. If you want the
                 driver for your controller, consider donating one - by now,
                 the implementation is pretty straightforward, it takes a
                 day or two of straight coding.
            
                 <p>
                 
            <dt> <strong>I've bought the FT639 and put it together, and it
                 doesn't work, what the hell?</strong>
                 
            <dd> The picture at the FerretTronics <a
                 href="http://www.ferrettronics.com/faq.html#CircuitBoardQ4">FAQ
                 page</a> is ambiguous. It looks like a back of DB-9 female
                 connector, while in reality it is a <strong>male</strong>
                 connector. The signal goes to pin 3, the ground goes to pin
                 5.
            
                 <p>
                 
                 If this fails, check if the signal level on the chip input
                 is high enough. I had to short the 20K resistor to make it
                 work with my Asus P-2B onboard serial controller (well,
                 that was before I sorted out the confusion with the pinout,
                 I'm surprised it worked at all... Hope I didn't bust my
                 serial port...)
                 
                 <p>
                 
             <dt> <strong>What is this "silent mode" thing?</strong>
             
             <dd> If you are familiar with the servos, you probably know
                  that they can make a sound that can make you jump,
                  especially caught off guard. The application this project
                  is serving is intended to have the servos operate next to
                  people whose comfort level is paramount, so they must not
                  be scared do death periodically when the servos come to
                  life.
                  
                  <p>
                  
                  As a side effect, this reduces the energy consumption (the
                  servo not getting the pulse goes to a powerdown and
                  consumes about 8mA - thanks again, Chester) and servo
                  wear. Since the servos may be working 24x7, this may be
                  important as well.
                  
                  <p>

             <dt> <strong>Why do I keep getting <code>noClassDefFoundError:
                  javax/comm/UnsupportedCommOperationException</code>?</strong>
                  
             <dd> Because you didn't install the <a
                  href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/">JavaCOMM</a>
                  properly. If you keep getting probems even though you've
                  followed the instructions to the letter, try to go with
                  the JRE instead of JDK - copy the <code>comm.jar</code> to
                  <code>${JRE_HOME}/lib/ext</code> directory.
                  
                  <p>
                  
                  As a rule of thumb, the newer the version of the JDK/JRE,
                  the less problems you will have.
                  
                  <p>
                  
             <dt> <strong>Every time the USB device is disconnected and then
                  reconnected again, I get the <code>SecurityException</code>.
                  How to avoid this?</strong>
                  
             <dd> You have to properly mount the usbfs. It would be a good
                  idea to add the following entry to your
                  <code>/etc/fstab</code>:
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  
                      <code>usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs devmode=0666 0 0</code>
                      
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  This will enable all the users to access the usbfs.
                  Alternatives are possible, look up the usbfs documentation
                  for that.
