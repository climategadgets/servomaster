        <h1>ServoMaster: Future Plans And Crazy Ideas</h1>
    
        <h2>Crazy idea #1, a.k.a. future plan #1</h2>
        
        The cable from the servo controller to the servo has to be very
        short. The reason for this is that the signal from the controller to
        the servo is PWM, which makes it prone to degradation and picking up
        noise. While the regular circuits react to the noice with more or
        less graceful degradation, noise on PWM signal makes the servos
        jitter, which in some cases makes them completely unusable. The
        longer the cable, the higher the chance to render the servo
        unusable.
        
        <p>
        
        There are ways to fight this phenomenon: put a capacitor between the
        ground and V<sub>cc</sub>, put a signal amplifier (a.k.a. servo
        booster) next to the servo, shield the cable, make it thicker, etc. 
        All these solutions do work to some extent. Depending on the length
        of the cable, they may or may not be sufficient. But all of them
        have the same basic problem: they are analog, consequently, they can
        alleviate the problem, but not eliminate it completely. In my
        extreme case (a requirement to control a servo that is 100+ feet
        from the computer), they are unlikely to work (this remains to be
        seen, but something tells me I'm right :()
        
        <p>
        
        So, to <i>eliminate</i> the problem, the paradigm shift is required.
        
        <p>
        
        Here goes.
        
        <p>
        
        There is a solution that is known to work reliably over reasonably
        long connections. It is called <a
        href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/1st_pages/tb1.htm">1-Wire&reg;
        Protocol</a>. There is a whole family of devices working using this
        protocol (<a href="http://dbserv.maxim-ic.com/1-Wire.cfm">here</a>),
        and the guys did a great job on putting together the API for
        communicating with those devices (<a
        href="http://www.ibutton.com/software/index.html">here</a>). These
        device are controllable, and the whole concept is beautiful.
        
        <p>
        
        Getting to the point, I can use a 1-Wire&reg; device to control the
        PWM oscillator that is, in turn, controlling the servo that is right
        next to it. The 1-Wire&reg; devices usually have a small footprint
        and are cheap (the most expensive I've bought so far was under $5,
        not counting the controller, which is $10), so this solution is just
        about as good as any other, except one fact: it is reliable and
        exact by definition. It is <strong>digital</strong>.
        
        <p>
        
        Details are to be defined. Stay tuned.
