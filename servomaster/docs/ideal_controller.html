        <h1>ServoMaster: A Dream About The Ideal Servo Controller</h1>
    
        <font size="-1"><i>As the work continues, some of the ideas below
        will be implemented.  As soon as that happens, the corresponding
        parts of the text will be marked <font
        color="blue">blue</font>.</i></font>
        
        <p>
        
        An ideal servo controller should be able to do at least this:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li> Report the status.
            
            <li> <font color="blue">Support the capabilities
                 discovery.</font> Of course, on the hardware level the
                 servo can't really tell much about itself, but the
                 abstraction should support it.
                 
            <li> Implication: a database of servos in existence would not
                 take much space, but will be very useful.
                 
            <li> Complication: the servo speed and torque changes as the
                 voltage changes, so coming up with a uniform description
                 for this dependency is going to be tricky.
            
            <li> It should be possible to control the parameters for each
                 servo separately (in other words, the servo abstraction
                 should be configurable).
            
            <li> It should be possible to preset the minimum and maximum
                 angle for the servo. And not only 90&deg; vs. 180&deg;, but
                 arbitrary angle.  Implied: the pulse length range. The
                 limits may be defined by the servo construction and/or
                 mechanical layout of the apparatus in which the servo is
                 used. Implied: range should be included into capabilities
                 discovery.
                 
            <li> It should be possible to preset the servo center position. 
                 The actual implementation center may be different from
                 position 128 (assuming the max is 255) due to the limits
                 described above.
                 
            <li> <font color="blue">The servo interface shouldn't realy
                 accept the values from 0 to 255 for the servo position, but
                 rather 0.0 to 1.0 (extreme left to extreme right). The
                 reason is, different controllers have different value
                 ranges - some operate from 0 to 255, some from 0 to 254,
                 some use the high bit as the direction indicator and the
                 rest as position. Implied: precision is different. Implied:
                 controller precision should be included into capabilities
                 discovery.</font>
                 
            <li> Consequence: why not allow to set the arbitrary left,
                 center and right border, like it is possible to do with the
                 slider controls?
                 
            <li> <font color="blue">Provide the coordinate transformation
                 between the physical servo position and input value. Useful
                 for compensating the rotational servo movement to linear
                 controlled body movement, as well as applications where the
                 natural input value range differs from 0...1 (for example,
                 steering wheels and rudders). This abstraction shouldn't be
                 really a part of the servo abstraction, but rather a module
                 you can plug the servo into.</font>
            
            <li> <font color="blue">Inverting the coordinate polarity to reverse the servo is
                 not exactly a life saver, but can be useful and is really
                 simple. It can be a part of the coordinate transformation
                 module as well.</font>
                 
            <li> <font color="blue">Implication: the coordinate
                 transformation module interface should be stackable.</font>
                 
            <li> Provide the means to incorporate the closed loop feedback
                 signal and mapping between the feedback and control.
                 
            <li> The ideal servo controller doesn't necessarily have to be
                 integrated - there are cases when the servos are located in
                 remote locations. The surface mount design can possibly fit
                 on the back of the servo.                 

            <li> Implication: it's not that the abstraction of the
                 <strong>servo controller</strong> that is important, it is the
                 abstraction of the <strong>servo</strong>.
                 
            <li> However, the abstraction of the servo controller is
                 important as well: even though the actual servo drivers may
                 be physically and logically separated, they are accessed in
                 the same uniform manner.
                 
            <li> From the practical standpoint: how do I care if the
                 controller is one piece or distributed, as long as the cost is
                 comparable?
                 
            <li> The ideal controller should not be resource hungry. The
                 currently available solutions require a dedicated serial
                 port to control them, why? Good candidates: USB, 1-Wire.
                 
            <li> Smooth transition done in hardware is a desirable feature.
            
            <li> Actually, it goes beyond just the smooth transition. It is
                 better described as a controlled transition. The transition
                 pattern can be specified, for example, just a simple linear
                 transition in a given time, or a constant and/or limited
                 acceleration transition (good with moving heavy controlled
                 bodies), or approximation transition (good when the
                 exactness of approach to the specified position is
                 required), or any sort of special effect ("drunken
                 master").
                 
            <li> Transition controller isn't really stackable, so it is
                 enough to "attach" one to the servo abstraction.
            
            <li> Transition controller may interfere with the coordination
                 transformers, so there should be a possibility to attach it
                 at any level of the coordination transformer stack.
