            <p>
            
                The Java implementation is rock solid - been working as a
                part of <link href="ext:dz/">DIY Zoning</link> for several
                years by now.
                 
            </p>
            <p>
            
                The C++ implementation is breathing and is marginally usable
                (for Phidgets), but by no means complete or stable. <link
                href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34418">CVS</link>
                module name is <code>servomaster-cpp</code>.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                
                No architecture changes are expected at this time - the
                project is functionally complete.

                    Documented the procedure to prevent the kernel modules
                    from interfering with Servomaster code.

                    Site cleanup caused by obsolescence of the content
                    management system formerly used. Another dose of <link
                    href="ext:rxtx">RxTx</link> upgrade pains. Good news,
                    may be able to take care of those pesky <link
                    href="site:serial-usb">USB/Serial</link> bridges the
                    right way.

                <p>
                
                    Unrelated to above, a backward incompatible codebase
                    change to utilize features offered by JDK 1.5 is in
                    progress. In particular, <link
                    href="site:meta_index">metadata</link> implementation
                    will be augmented and/or replaced with JDK 1.5 <link
                    href="ext:jdk15_annotations">annotations</link>, and
                    <link href="ext:jmx">JMX</link>, which is now a part of
                    the JDK.

                    Finished a usable driver and documentation for <link
                    href="site:pololu">Pololu</link> family of servo
                    controllers. The driver will be included into the next
                    release, so far you can get it from the <link
                    href="site:cvs">CVS</link>.

                    Site redesign started. It's been overdue for a while :)

                <p>
                
                    Contrary to previously expressed intent, <link
                    href="ext:jusb/">jUSB</link> <em>was</em> replaced with
                    <link href="ext:javax-usb">javax.usb</link>.  So far,
                    just for development release, just to get a feel for it,
                    but if things continue the way they are (last jUSB
                    release was in 2001, last <code>javax.usb</code> in
                    April 2004), <code>javax.usb</code> may just as well
                    become the default implementation.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                
                    At the very least, this change allowed to significantly
                    simplify disconnect handling and eventually fix <link
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=617284&amp;group_id=34418&amp;atid=412121">bug
                    #617284</link> (Disconnected mode broken), almost
                    exactly two years after it was opened.

                     <link href="ext:jusb">jUSB</link> is about to release an
                     RPM, and Servomaster RPM was modified to be able to depend
                     on jUSB RPM.  Decision to port USB code to <link
                     href="ext:javax-usb/">javax.usb</link> is hereby cancelled,
                     for it seems that <code>javax.usb</code> has fallen a
                     victim to political struggle - there's nothing but spam in
                     <code>javax.usb</code> mailing lists.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                
                    Servomaster RPM is available <link
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34418&amp;package_id=108815">here</link>. 
                    Hope it makes it easier to install.  Two issues remain:
                    <link href="ext:jusb">jUSB</link> and <link
                    href="ext:rxtx">RxTx</link> are not yet available as
                    RPM.

                    update: Major breakthrough - the timeout problem was
                    finally fixed with new firmware. As a bonus, the
                    controller now supports servo shutoff.

                    Not all the wrinkles have been ironed out yet - the
                    silent mode is reported as supported, but is not
                    activated.  Disconnected mode is still broken.

                    CVS version of AdvancedServo driver is functional at
                    this point.
