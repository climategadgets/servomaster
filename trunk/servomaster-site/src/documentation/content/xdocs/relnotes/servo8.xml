                This is the most advanced servo controller I was able to get
                a hold of so far.

            <p>

                The driver for this device is available
                since release 0.4p2.
                
            </p>
            <p>
            
                This driver will not support the serial interface: it is too
                slow, and the serial port estate is <strong>really</strong>
                expensive. The user is encouraged to use the USB connection
                instead.

                     The number of servos supported now is 8;

                <li>
                
                     Servo velocity can be controlled;

                <li>
                
                     Servo acceleration can be controlled;

                <li>
                
                     Servo position feedback is available from the
                     controller;

                     Communication interface has changed from
                     <code>control_msg</code> to <code>bulk write</code> -
                     less overhead;

                     The device is now bootable - if there's a problem with
                     the firmware, you don't have to order a new one, just
                     get the fresh firmware and reboot it;

                It was worth the wait.

            <title>Aftermath</title>
            
            <p>
            
                Apparently, this prototype never made it to production. Too
                bad, because I'm yet to see another controller that sports
                functionality and stability this prototype has.
                
            </p>
            <p>
            
                Even though this controller can't be bought, I know that
                there's a number of people that have the prototype, so the
                driver will stay published.
