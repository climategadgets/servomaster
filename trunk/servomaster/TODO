- Setting the silent timeout brings the device back to active mode; think if
  this is something that really has to be happening

- Add the JDK 1.3 shutdown handler for the Console: put the controller into
  a sleep mode

- Implement dynamic metadata calculation for changing the controller/servo
  settings (changing precision for range change)

- Figure out the minimum and maximum pulse length for the available
  instances of Futaba servos and change the phidget servo view accordingly.

- Change the build infrastructure so FT639 doesn't get built unless
  explicitly requested. Think about the case when no hardware drivers were
  requested - the model itself does make sense, but not too much. A special
  "model-only" switch might make sense.

- Implement the silent mode for the servo instance (vs. controller instance)

- Implement the lazy mode for the servo instance (vs. controller instance)

- Implement the transition listener
