                <p>
                
                    Basically, you're likely to run into a single problem,
                    namely, installing and using <link
                    href="ext:rxtx">RxTx</link> (which you'll need for all
                    serial drivers to work).
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    For me, version 1.4-15 worked (and still works, with uptime
                    measured in months) perfectly, however, it can be a real
                    pain in the neck to compile on new platforms, and I don't
                    even remember if I ever compiled it successfully with JDK
                    1.5.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Recently, the situation [allegedly] improved, and versions
                    after 2.1-7pre20 <em>may</em> work without segfaulting
                    within a minute. Caveat emptor.

                <title>USB</title>
                
                <p>
                
                    Starting with release <code>0.6p3dev1</code>, <link
                    href="ext:jusb">jUSB</link> was replaced with <link
                    href="ext:javax-usb"><code>javax.usb</code></link>.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Moreover, to make things more seamless,
                    <code>javax.usb</code> is now prepackaged with
                    ServoMaster, so it should be mostly invisible to you.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    The change was quite drastic and backward incompatible.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Should you run into problems with jUSB-based version,
                    try <code>javax.usb</code>-based version first. Should
                    you run into problems with <code>javax.usb</code>-based
                    version, please <link href="site:bugs">report
                    them</link> so I can fix them right away.
                    
                </p>

                    Unfortunately, SourceForge doesn't notify me of
                    <em>all</em> new bugs immediately, only those that were
                    assigned to me. You may want to doublecheck your bug
                    report by writing a message to the <link
                    href="site:lists">mailing list</link>.
