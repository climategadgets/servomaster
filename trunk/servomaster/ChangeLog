0.4p0	- New driver is being introduced: the PhidgetServoController. Since
	  this is a qualitative (1 => N), not a quantitative (N => N+1)
	  change, it can be considered a rewrite - the
	  AbstractServoController was born implementing the features common
	  for two so different controllers.
	- Common parts for the existing controllers are merged into
	  AbstractServoController
	- New functionality added to the Servo: ability to specify the
	  timings and per-servo silent mode support
	- Console changed to allow the controller port automatic discovery,
	  if it is supported by the controller driver
	- Silent mode handler is rewritten, now it supports both the
	  controller and the servo (and generally anything)

0.3p2	- Fixed a major synchronization screwup (made possible by JDK 1.4
	  final): there were synchronization locks on both the controller
	  instance (requested by the silencer and heartbeat threads) and
	  servo instance (positioning requests), at the same time the servo
	  positioning methods were using the synchronized controller
	  methods, as a result, deadlock occured.
	- Implemented consistent initialization check - now it is not
	  possible for the controller implementation to pretend it's working
	  or give the wrong problem cause if it wasn't initialized yet

0.3p1	- More bugfixes
	- Lazy mode added: the command to the controller will not be sent
	  unless it is actually required
	- Heartbeat: if there was no positioning commands within
	  configurable time interval, the servo position will be set again,
	  just in case it drifted away. Also works with controller power
	  blackouts

0.3p0	- API FREEZE
	- More bugfixes
	- Console improved
	- Documentation updated

0.2p2	- Mostly bugfixes

0.2p1	- Added the coordination transforation support and some transformers
        - Reflected the coordination transformation on the console

0.2p0	- API changed to accept double 0...1 instead of int 0...255
        - controller and servo metadata added
        - major bugfixes related to the above changes - one bug still
          lingers, it's not possible to get up to the max in smooth mode,
          but what the hell, let's release now and fix later - it's going to
          be in 0.2p1
        - minor bugfixes not related to the API changes

0.1p2

	- Servos change position according to the range selection immediately after
          the range change and don't wait until the next setPosition() is
          issued
	- After the controller reset, the slider is set to the proper (central)
	  position
	- ServoView implementation is now vendor-independent
	- Gave up on fixing the header length behavior for FT639

0.1p1

	- The servo controller view is not hardware-specific anymore
	- Header length figured out for FT639
	- Interfaces changed to accomodate the servo controller view panel
	- Controller view implemented for FT639
	- Removed unnecessary methods from FT639 implementation
	- Removed ambiguous methods from the Servo interface
	- Tuned up the Console appearance
	- Added the demos to the Console
	- Updated the documentation

0.1p0

	- Initial release. Basic functionality.
