        <h2>Good things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in inexpensive.
            
            <li> Simple. Takes an hour or less for somebody familiar with
                 the craft to put it together.
                 
            <li> The protocol has a relatively low overhead (for example,
                 SSC has an overhead of 33.3% - every command (two bytes)
                 has to start with the sync byte).
                 
            <li> Has a single power source. For me, this might have been a
                 deciding factor.
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bad things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in having limited functionality.
            
                 <p>
            
            <li> Is a write-only device. It is not possible to even tell
                 whether it is connected to the serial port, save read the
                 status. Minimal functionality, like "controller ready"
                 status reflected on hardware flow control pin, would be
                 great.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <li> I think the guys really, really underestimate the necessity
                 of higher speed communication. Consider this: on 2400 baud,
                 it takes about 10-11 milliseconds to transmit a command to
                 the servo with the protocol currently used. It allows up to
                 100 steps per second when controlling a single servo.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 When controlling five servos simultaneously (maximum
                 supported by FT639) this figure drops down to about 20
                 steps per second.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 When controlling twenty five servos simultaneously (maximum
                 supported by FT649) this figure drops to about 4 (four)
                 steps per second.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 Suppose, I have a requirement of controlling the servos in
                 a smooth, silent manner, or smoothly and precisely. Does
                 this requirement get satisfied when I have twenty five
                 servos? No. Please note, that raising the communication
                 speed to 9600 baud is hardly enough. 19200 seems to be more
                 or less acceptable.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 Oh well.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <li> More about communication speed (thanks, Chester): there are
                 actully two separate issues: latency and bandwidth. I
                 believe in this case the latency is negligible (more
                 numbers later), because the mechanical delays in the
                 apparatus connected to the servo may more or less be of
                 comparable order with the protocol latency. Bandwidth,
                 however, <strong>is</strong> an issue here.
            
            <li> Be careful with the header length support. The lower values
                 for the header length make the controller issue really
                 short pulses that make the servos go out of range. The
                 indication of that (at least for <a
                 href="http://www.servocity.com/Products/Futaba_Servos_/S3003_Standard/s3003_standard.html">Futaba
                 S3003</a>) is a high-pitch noise (ever been to the dentist? 
                 The kind of noise their tools have, but higher). I don't
                 think it is very good for the servo, and it definitely
                 makes the servo uncontrollable.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 The default value for the header length (doesn't seem to be
                 0, doesn't seem to be 15 (maximum), doesn't seem to be 7)
                 works just fine. Use this feature only if everything else
                 fails. Keep in mind that this is a controller-wide feature,
                 not servo specific.
