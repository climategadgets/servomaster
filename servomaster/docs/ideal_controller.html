        <h1>ServoMaster: A Dream About The Ideal Servo Controller</h1>
    
        An ideal servo controller should be able to do at least this:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li> Report the status.
            
            <li> Support the capabilities discovery. Of course, on the
                 hardware level the servo can't really tell much about
                 itself, but the abstraction should support it.
                 
            <li> Implication: a database of servos in existence would not
                 take much space, but will be very useful.
            
            <li> It should be possible to control the parameters for each
                 servo separately (in other words, the servo abstraction
                 should be configurable).
            
            <li> It should be possible to preset the minimum and maximum
                 angle for the servo. And not only 90&deg; vs. 180&deg;, but
                 arbitrary angle.  Implied: the pulse length range. The
                 limits may be defined by the servo construction and/or
                 mechanical layout of the apparatus in which the servo is
                 used. Implied: range should be included into capabilities
                 discovery.
                 
            <li> It should be possible to preset the servo center. The
                 actual implementation center may be different from position
                 128 due to the limits described above.
                 
            <li> The servo interface shouldn't realy accept the values from
                 0 to 255 for the servo position, but rather 0.0 to 1.0
                 (extreme left to extreme right). The reason is, different
                 controllers have different value ranges - some operate from
                 0 to 255, some from 0 to 254, some use the high bit as the
                 direction indicator and the rest as position. Implied:
                 precision is different. Implied: controller precision
                 should be included into capabilities discovery.
                 
            <li> Consequence: why not allow to set the arbitrary left,
                 center and right border, like it is possible to do with the
                 slider controls?
                 
            <li> Provide the coordinate transformation between the physical
                 servo position and input value. Useful for compensating the
                 rotational servo movement to linear controlled body
                 movement, as well as applications where the natural input
                 value range differs from 0...1 (for example, steering
                 wheels and rudders). This abstraction shouldn't be really a
                 part of the servo astraction, but rather a module you can
                 plug the servo into.
            
            <li> Inverting the coordinate polarity to reverse the servo is
                 not exactly a life saver, but can be useful and is really
                 simple. It can be a part of the coordinate transformation
                 module as well.
                 
            <li> Implication: the coordinate transformation module interface
                 should be stackable.
                 
            <li> Provide the means to incorporate the closed loop feedback
                 signal and mapping between the feedback and control.
                 
            <li> The ideal servo controller doesn't necessarily have to be
                 integrated - there are cases when the servos are located in
                 remote locations. The surface mount design can possibly fit
                 on the back of the servo.                 

            <li> Implication: it's not that the abstraction of the
                 <strong>servo controller</strong> that is important, it is the
                 abstraction of the <strong>servo</strong>.
                 
            <li> However, the abstraction of the servo controller is
                 important as well: even though the actual servo drivers may
                 be physically and logically separated, they are accessed in
                 the same uniform manner.
                 
            <li> From the practical standpoint: how do I care if the
                 controller is one piece or distributed, as long as the cost is
                 comparable?
                 
            <li> The ideal controller should not be resource hungry. The
                 currently available solutions require a dedicated serial
                 port to control them, why? Good candidates: USB, 1-Wire.
                 
            <li> Smooth transition done in hardware is a desirable feature.
            
        </ul>
