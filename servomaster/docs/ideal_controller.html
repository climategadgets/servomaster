        <h1>ServoMaster: A Dream About The Ideal Servo Controller</h1>
    
        An ideal servo controller should be able to do at least this:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li> Report the status.
            
            <li> Support the capabilities discovery. Of course, on the
                 hardware level the servo can't really tell much about
                 itself, but the abstraction should support it.
                 
            <li> Implication: a database of servos in existence would not
                 take much space, but will be very useful.
            
            <li> It should be possible to control the parameters for each
                 servo separately (in other words, the servo abstraction
                 should be configurable).
            
            <li> It should be possible to preset the minimum and maximum
                 angle for the servo. Implied: the pulse length. The limits
                 may be defined by the servo construction and/or mechanical
                 layout of the apparatus in which the servo is used.
                 
            <li> It should be possible to preset the servo center. The
                 actual implementation center may be different from position
                 128 due to the limits described above.
                 
            <li> Provide the coordinate transformation between the physical
                 servo position and input value. Useful for compensating the
                 rotational servo movement to linear controlled body
                 movement.
                 
            <li> Provide the means to incorporate the closed loop feedback
                 signal and mapping between the feedback and control.
                 
            <li> The ideal servo controller doesn't necessarily have to be
                 integrated - there are cases when the servos are located in
                 remote locations. The surface mount design can possibly fit
                 on the back of the servo.
                 
            <li> Implication: it's not that the abstraction of the
                 <strong>servo controller</strong> that is important, it is the
                 abstraction of the <strong>servo</strong>.
                 
            <li> From the practical standpoint: how do I care if the
                 controller is one piece or distributed, as long as the cost is
                 comparable?
                 
            <li> The ideal controller should not be resource hungry. The
                 currently available solutions require a dedicated serial
                 port to control them, why? Good candidates: USB, 1-Wire.
                 
            <li> Smooth transition done in hardware is a desirable feature.
            
        </ul>
