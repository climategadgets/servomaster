                What hardware is supported?

            </question>

                <p>
                
                    Two generic classes of controllers are supported: serial
                    and USB. Specific list is:

                    However, a lot of attention was paid to making the code
                    as abstract and reusable as possible, therefore, writing
                    a driver for a new device should take just a few days,
                    if not hours.

                What is this "silent mode" thing?

            </question>
            <answer>

                <p>
                
                    If you are familiar with the servos, you probably know
                    that they can make a sound that can make you jump,
                    especially caught off guard. The application this
                    project is serving is intended to have the servos
                    operate next to people whose comfort level is paramount,
                    so they must not be scared do death periodically when
                    the servos come to life.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    Also, as servos wear down, they sometimes start
                    "growling".

                </p>
                <p>
                
                    In order to reduce noise related to servo operation, it
                    is possible to shut off the pulse to the servo - it
                    enters the "sleep mode" shortly thereafter. While
                    sleeping, it emits no noise.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                     
                    As a side effect, this reduces the energy consumption
                    (the sleeping servo goes to a powerdown and consumes
                    about 8mA - thanks again, Chester) and servo wear. Since
                    the servos may be working 24x7, this may be important as
                    well.

                The Servomaster debug console doesn't fit into my screen!

            </question>
            <answer>

                <p>
                
                    Well, since the advent of 16-servo controllers it
                    doesn't fit into my 1600x1200 screen, either.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    This is unfortunate, and there are two things that can
                    possibly be done:

                </p>
                <ul>
                
                    <li>
                    
                        Decrease the size of the console elements to make it
                        all smaller. This is quite painful to implement
                        (basically I'll have to change the default font on
                        every single element), and will make the font
                        unreadable, which is unacceptable for me. Don't ask
                        for it, I won't do it.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    
                        Make the console frame scrollable. This has already
                        been done, and while it does look ugly, remember
                        that this is just a debug console we're talking
                        about, and I'd hate to put efforts into it if I can
                        do something more useful instead.
                        
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>
                
                    So, the solution is to just change the frame size - and
                    the contents will become scrollable.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                
                    Because you didn't install the <link

                    keep getting probems even though you've followed the
                    instructions to the letter, try to go with the JRE
                    instead of JDK - copy the <code>comm.jar</code> to

                ServoMaster doesn't detect my USB controller, why?

                <p>
                
                    This seems to be a peculiarity related to the way <link
                    href="ext:javax-usb">javax.usb</link> security is
                    implemented.

                <p>
                
                    Quick fix: <code>chmod -R a+w /proc/bus/usb</code> -
                    this will allow you to test whether the controller is
                    connected. Alternative way is to use
                    <code>usbview</code> utility, it should show the device
                    unconditionally (if it is present, that is).

                <warning>
                
                    It is not recommended to run ServoMaster code as root,
                    for security reasons. Nothing in particular, but I'm
                    just paranoid.

                <p>
                
                    A more thorough solution involves properly configuring

                <p>
                
                    The symptom is usually a complaint about the fact that
                    the USB interface is already claimed.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                
                    This is due to the fact that [at least] <link
                    href="site:phidget_quad">QuadServo</link> advertises
                    itself as a HID class device, but in fact doesn't
                    properly implement HID specifications (if I remember
                    Chester's explanations right).
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                
                    Quick fix is: <code>rmmod hid</code>. A more thorough
                    solution would be to add <code>hid</code> to <link
                    href="ext:hotplug">hotplug</link> blacklist, but both of
                    these have an unfortunate side effect of disabling
                    <em>all</em> HID devices. Let's hope that hotplug
                    becomes smart enough to ban individual devices.

                    Module name may be other than <code>hid</code> for some
                    distributions. In particular, for newer Fedora it is
