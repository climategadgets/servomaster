        <h2>Good things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in inexpensive.
            
            <li> Simple. Takes an hour or less for somebody familiar with
                 the craft to put it together.
                 
            <li> Has a single power source. For me, this might have been a
                 deciding factor.
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bad things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> Cheap, as in having limited functionality.
            
                 <p>
            
            <li> Is a write-only device. It is not possible to even tell
                 whether it is connected to the serial port, save read the
                 status. Minimal functionality, like "controller ready"
                 status reflected on hardware flow control pin, would be
                 great.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <li> I think the guys really, really underestimate the necessity
                 of higher speed communication. Consider this: on 2400 baud,
                 it takes about 10-11 milliseconds to transmit a command to
                 the servo with the protocol currently used. It allows up to
                 100 steps per second when controlling a single servo.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 When controlling five servos simultaneously (maximum
                 supported by FT639) this figure drops down to about 20
                 steps per second.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 When controlling twenty five servos simultaneously (maximum
                 supported by FT649) this figure drops to about 4 (four)
                 steps per second.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 Suppose, I have a requirement of controlling the servos in
                 a smooth, silent manner, or smoothly and precisely. Does
                 this requirement get satisfied when I have twenty five
                 servos? No. Please note, that raising the communication
                 speed to 9600 baud is hardly enough. 19200 seems to be more
                 or less acceptable.
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 Oh well.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <li> This one drives me nuts. The "header length" command. With
                 the header length set less than 9-10, the servo (your
                 typical one, <a
                 href="http://www.servocity.com/Products/Futaba_Servos_/S3003_Standard/s3003_standard.html">Futaba
                 S3003</a>) starts behaving funny, doesn't want to move when
                 the position gets in the lower half, and starts emitting
                 the disturbing high-pitch noise (ever been to the dentist?
                 The kind of noise their tools have). I don't think this is
                 normal. Plus, this feature is not documented clearly. Plus,
                 the reasonable default value should be 0, or it has to be
                 documented, and the default value for the header length
                 doesn't seem to be neither 0 nor 15 (the maximum value).
                 
                 <p>
                 
                 I'll just leave this feature disabled, to prevent damage to
                 the servo. If someone can enlighten me on what's going on,
                 I would definitely appreciate that. Too bad I don't have
                 an oscilloscope to take look at the signal.
