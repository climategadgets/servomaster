                 ServoMaster is dedicated to providing a consistent hardware
                 independent way of controlling the servos with the personal
                 computer.

            <p>
            
                There is a lot of servos used in radio controlled modeling
                or robotics applications, and there are vendors
                manufacturing the hardware controllers allowing to control
                the servos, to name a few:

                    Quite a lot of vendors providing the hardware
                    controllers based on PIC16F84 device.
                    
                </li>
                     
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                
                However, almost all of them (with <link
                href="site:phidget_quad">notable exceptions</link>), being
                in the hardware manufacturing business, care little about
                providing a consistent interface for the servos and
                controllers. This is understandable, but disappointing,
                because all the servos are just about the same, and the
                basic functionality of the controllers is just about the
                same.

            <p>
                
                This <em>can</em> and <em>is</em> being fixed, right here.

            <title>Brief History</title>
            
            <p>
            
                 ServoMaster was created as a complimentary project
                 necessary to satisfy the needs of another project, <link
                 href="ext:dz">DIY
                 Zoning</link>. Being lazy (hate to rewrite the same code
                 ten times), I decided to just make it generic from the very
                 beginning. It turned out to be fun. Then, <link
                 href="ext:phidgets">Chester</link> showed up, and it
                 started to be really fun ;)
