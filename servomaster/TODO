- Change the servo interface for setPosition() from 0...255 to 0.0...1.0

- Introduce the coordinate transformer with configurable low limit, high
  limit and center; figure out the nonlinear transfer function between the
  0...1 transformer input and 0...255 servo input

- Implement the transition end notification for smooth movement (notifies
  immediately when not in smooth mode)
