        Keep in mind that the hardware version for which this driver is
        provided is different (later) from the one described on the <a
        href="http://www.phidgets.com/phidget-servo/phidget-servo.html">site</a>. 
        Since the Phidgets are evolving rather rapidly, the versioning,
        capabilities discovery, and support are expected to be a standard
        part of this driver.
        
        <h2>Good things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> <strong>Reliable as hell.</strong> The manufacturer wants
                 me to make it fail, I couldn't.
                 
            <li> <strong>Simple to use.</strong> Plug in the USB, plug in
                 the servos, go.
            
            <li> <strong>Versatile.</strong> One of the servos is powered by
                 the USB bus, so it is possible to start playing with it
                 right away even without external power supply.
                 
            <li> <strong>Precise.</strong> The actual controller is
                 controlled by the pulse timings it has to provide to the
                 servos. Usable range for the servos is somewhere from 200us
                 to 2100us, which makes the resolution of 1900 steps. If
                 your servo is capable of working in a wider pulse range,
                 you get more steps available.
                 
            <li> <strong>Generic.</strong> It is a USB HID device, enough
                 said.
            
            <li> <strong>Fast.</strong> The bandwidth is limited by the
                 servo inertia, not by the protocol or interface.
                 
            <li> <strong>Flexible.</strong> You can control properties on
                 per-servo basis.
                 
            <li> <strong>Customizable</strong>. To the best of my
                 understanding, the manufacturer will provide custom
                 solutions - different number of servo outputs per board,
                 different protocol support and basically whatever you need.
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bad things</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> As of now, it's still a write-only device. I don't think
                 it's such a big deal for <strong>this</strong> device -
                 otherwise, it's near perfect. The only extra ability that I
                 would like to see is the hardware level transition support,
                 but admittedly, that's a lot to ask ;)
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Making it work</h2>
        
        You have to get the suitable Java USB support. Currently, the code
        is based on <a href="http://jusb.sourceforge.net/">jUSB</a>, which
        makes it available only on Linux. Cross-platform solution is being
        developed.
        
        <p>
        
        You have to use <code>--with-phidget</code> configure option to
        enable the Phidget support (it is disabled by default), and
        <code>--with-jusb=&lt;DIR&gt;</code> option to specify the root
        directory of jUSB.
        
        <p>
        
        When you are ready to use it, don't forget to put
        <code>jusb.jar</code> in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> and add the
        directory where <code>libjusb.so</code> resides to your
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. If you are using the scripts supplied
        with the source tarball (look into
        <code>${install_prefix}/bin</code>, it's already taken care of.
        
        <p>
        
        Another thing to take care of is <code>/proc/bus/usb</code>
        permissions. You probably don't want to run this code as root, so
        either you have to manually modify the device permissions so you
        have read/write access (you have to do it every time after the
        device is plugged in or the system is rebooted), or use the <a
        href="http://www.xena.uklinux.net/Linux/usb_perms.html">USB
        Permissions Daemon</a> to maintain them for you. I haven't checked
        the status of this with 2.4 kernel, though, it may be fixed already.

        Beauty incarnated ;)
