            <dt> <strong>What is a project status?</strong>
            
            <dd> Architecture is clear, design is done, Java implementation
                 for one of the controllers (<a href="FT639.html">FT639</a>)
                 is done. Second is coming. Stay tuned.
                 
                 <p>
        
            <dt> <strong>Why Java?</strong>
            
            <dd> First of all, this is my current language of choice. 
                 Second, it is good for rapid prototyping. Third, and
                 probably the most important, despite all its drawbacks, it
                 is really platform independent. This last one matters a
                 lot, at least to me.
                 
                 <p>
            
            <dt> <strong>What about C?</strong>
            
            <dd> No C. C++ port, though, is planned. Don't ask about the
                 timeframe. If you want to help, you're welcome.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <dt> <strong>Why FerretTronics is the only implementation
                 avaialable?</strong>
                 
            <dd> Because it was the cheapest thing available at the time,
                 almost half as expensive as the next one. Is it the best? 
                 No, <a href="ideal_controller.html">here's why</a>. Is it
                 the worst? Don't think so. It allows to do things other
                 controllers don't (header length feature). The protocol is
                 not bad either.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <dt> <strong>Are there other hardware controller drivers
                 coming?</strong>
                 
            <dd> You bet. The next one is probably <a
                 href="http://www.seetron.com/ssc.htm">SSC</a>, unless I get
                 to implement my <a href="future.html">crazy ideas</a>
                 sooner.
                 
                 <p>
                 
            <dt> <strong>I've bought the FT639 and put it together, and it
                 doesn't work, what the hell?</strong>
                 
            <dd> The picture at the FerretTronics <a
                 href="http://www.ferrettronics.com/faq.html#CircuitBoardQ4">FAQ
                 page</a> is ambiguous. It looks like a back of DB-9 female
                 connector, while in reality it is a <strong>male</strong>
                 connector. The signal goes to pin 3, the ground goes to pin
                 5.
            
                 <p>
                 
                 If this fails, check if the signal level on the chip input
                 is high enough. I had to short the 20K resistor to make it
                 work with my Asus P-2B onboard serial controller (well,
                 that was before I sorted out the confusion with the pinout,
                 I'm surprised it worked at all... Hope I didn't bust my
                 serial port...)
                 
                 <p>
                 
             <dt> <strong>What is this "silent mode" thing?</strong>
             
             <dd> If you are familiar with the servos, you probably know
                  that they can make a sound that can make you jump,
                  especially caught off guard. The application this project
                  is serving is intended to have the servos operate next to
                  people whose comfort level is paramount, so they must not
                  be scared do death periodically when the servos come to
                  life.
                  
                  <p>
                  
                  As a side effect, this reduces the energy consumption and
                  servo wear. Since the servos may be working 24x7, this may
                  be important as well.
