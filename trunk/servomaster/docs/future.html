                                The cable from the servo controller to the
                                servo has to be very short. The reason for
                                this is that the signal from the controller
                                to the servo is PWM, which makes it prone to
                                degradation and picking up noise. While the
                                regular circuits react to the noise with
                                more or less graceful degradation, noise on
                                PWM signal makes the servos jitter, which in
                                some cases makes them completely unusable.
                                The longer the cable, the higher the chance
                                to render the servo unusable.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                There are ways to fight this phenomenon: put
                                a capacitor between the ground and
                                V<sub>cc</sub>, put a signal amplifier
                                (a.k.a. servo booster) next to the servo,
                                shield the cable, make it thicker, etc.  All
                                these solutions do work to some extent.
                                Depending on the length of the cable, they
                                may or may not be sufficient. But all of
                                them have the same basic problem: they are
                                analog, consequently, they can alleviate the
                                problem, but not eliminate it completely. In
                                my extreme case (a requirement to control a
                                servo that is 100+ feet from the computer),
                                they are unlikely to work (this remains to
                                be seen, but something tells me I'm right
                                :()
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                So, to <i>eliminate</i> the problem, the
                                paradigm shift is required.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                Here goes.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                There is a solution that is known to work
                                reliably over reasonably long connections.
                                It is called <a
                                href="http://www.maxim-ic.com/1st_pages/tb1.htm">1-Wire&reg;
                                Protocol</a>. There is a whole family of
                                devices working using this protocol (<a
                                href="http://dbserv.maxim-ic.com/1-Wire.cfm">here</a>),
                                and the guys did a great job on putting
                                together the API for communicating with
                                those devices (<a
                                href="http://www.ibutton.com/software/index.html">here</a>).
                                These device are controllable, and the whole
                                concept is beautiful.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                Getting to the point, I can use a
                                1-Wire&reg; device to control the PWM
                                oscillator that is, in turn, controlling the
                                servo that is right next to it. The
                                1-Wire&reg; devices usually have a small
                                footprint and are cheap (the most expensive
                                I've bought so far was under $5, not
                                counting the controller, which is $10), so
                                this solution is just about as good as any
                                other, except one fact: it is reliable and
                                exact by definition. It is
                                <strong>digital</strong>.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                Too bad it is slow as hell. However, there
                                are applications where it is appropriate, so
                                not all hope is lost.
                                
                                <p>
                                
                                Details are to be defined. Stay tuned.
