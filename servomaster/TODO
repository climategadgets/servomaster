- Add ability to build the code from the same source tree on multiple hosts
  (NFS/Coda/Samba exported filesystems)

- Lazy mode is not properly supported

- Disconnected mode support has to be verified

- With the new Console.reset implementation, the control sliders are set to
  0.5, but the position sliders are set (along with the servo) to where it
  was last time before the reset button was pressed. Not good.

- Setting the silent timeout brings the device back to active mode; think if
  this is something that really has to be happening

- Add the JDK 1.3 shutdown handler for the Console: put the controller into
  a sleep mode

- Implement dynamic metadata calculation for changing the controller/servo
  settings (changing precision for range change)

- Figure out the minimum and maximum pulse length for the available
  instances of Futaba servos and change the phidget servo view accordingly.

- Change the build infrastructure so FT639 doesn't get built unless
  explicitly requested. Think about the case when no hardware drivers were
  requested - the model itself does make sense, but not too much. A special
  "model-only" switch might make sense.

- Implement the silent mode for the servo instance (vs. controller instance)

- Implement the lazy mode for the servo instance (vs. controller instance)

- Implement the transition listener
