        <h1>ServoMaster: Quick Start: Hard Way</h1>
        
        You don't really have to go this way, unless you are a developer and
        modifying the source code.
        
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li> <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</a>,
                 <code>--with-ANT</code> configure option. Minimum version
                 required is 1.4.
            
            <li> Sun's <code>javac.jar</code> or <code>tools.jar</code>,
                 <code>--with-JAVA_COMPILER</code> configure option. Examine
                 the Ant documentation to find out where it fits.
            
            <li> <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/">Apache
                 Xerces-J</a>, <code>--with-XERCES</code> configure option. 
                 Current version will suffice.
                 
            <li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm">Java
                 Communications API</a>. For Linux boxes, Trent Jarvi's <a
                 href="http://www.rxtx.org/">RxTx</a> - JavaCOMM
                 implementation.

        </ul>
        
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        
        The ServoMaster is being developed on the Linux and Solaris boxes,
        and there are no plans to provide a Windows build process. However,
        it is possible to build it on Windows using <a
        href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, and of course it is
        possible to use it on Windows - see the <a
        href="quickstart_jar.html">easy way</a>.
        
        <h2>Build</h2>
        
        Untar the source tarball, of course.
        
        <p>
        
        Hardcore OpenSource people will find the build process comfortable -
        it's simple <code>./configure && make all install</code>. However,
        it is highly recommended to run <code>./configure --help</code>
        first, because even though the <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
        is used to adjust the build to the system, the tools used (Ant and
        Xerces) do not have a standard location, thus it has to be
        specified.
        
        <p>
        
        To avoid specifying configure options again and again, it is
        recommended to use the <code>./configure-options</code> file to
        specify them, one item per line. This is how mine looks:
        
        <pre>
--with-ANT=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-ant-1.3/dist/lib/ant.jar
--with-JAVA_COMPILER=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-tools/javac.jar
--with-XERCES=/opt/java/jakarta/jakarta-ant/proposal/myrmidon/lib/xerces.jar
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Running the result</h2>
        
        There is a class that serves as a testbed and a demo for the package
        - <code>org.freehold.servomaster.view.Console</code>, and
        <code>$prefix/bin/ft_view</code> shell script is a wrapper for it. 
        It takes two parameters: the hardware driver class name, and the
        driver-specific port name. It is completely hardware independent.
        
        <p>
        
        There is no dummy class implementing nonexistent controller that
        doesn't require any hardware, however, the <a
        href="FT639.html">FT639</a> controller the driver for which has been
        already implemented doesn't provide any feedback, so it can be used
        as a demo. The only requirement is that you specify a valid
        unoccupied serial port ID, like this:
        
        <pre>
        $prefix/bin/ft_view \
                org.freehold.servomaster.device.impl.ft.FT639ServoController \
                /dev/ttyS1
        </pre>
        
        where <code>$prefix</code> is where you actually install the package.
        
        <p>
        
        That's it, you should be seeing the console right now.

            <dt> <b>Silent</b>
            
            <dd> The <b>Silent</b> checkbox, if checked (default if the
                 controller <a

                 it), puts the controller in a 'sleep' mode - stops the
                 servo pulse after a timeout.
            
            <dt> <b>ID</b>

            <dt> <b>Enabled</b>
            
            <dd> This checkbox enables (default) or disables the particular
                 servo.
            
            <dt> <b>Instant/Crawl</b>
            
            <dd> The transition controller selection. <b>Instant</b> means
                 that there is no transition controller attached,
                 <b>Crawl</b> means that the crawl transition controller is
                 attached to the servo. Read the <a
                 href="apidocs/org/freehold/servomaster/device/model/transition/CrawlTransitionController.html">javadocs</a>
                 on this class to find out more (you have to <code>'make
                 javadoc'</code> to use that link, or look it up on the <a
                 href="http://servomaster.sourceforge.net/">master
                 site</a>).
                 
            <dt> <b>Direct/Reverse/Linear</b>
            
            <dd> The coordinate transformer selection. <b>Direct</b> means
                 that there is no coordinate transformer, <b>Reverse</b> is
                 self-explanatory, and <b>Linear</b> is explained in the
                 class <a
                 href="apidocs/org/freehold/servomaster/device/model/transform/LinearTransformer.html">documentation</a>.
                 
            <dt> <b>The sliders</b>
            
            <dd> The right one controls, the left one displays. Play with
                 the transition controllers and coordinate transformers to
                 see what happens. Be careful with the servos - not all of
                 them like to be set to 180&deg; range.

        The stuff below pertains to the specific controller features, and is
        usually either self-explanatory or too weird to bother. Since the
        controller name is there, just look up the release notes on that
        particular controller in the <a href="index.html">index</a>.
